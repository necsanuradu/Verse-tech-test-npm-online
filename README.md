##  As state management I have published
the "formidable-forms-state@1.1.0" <br />
library/components

## If npm will have it online I hope and with no errors while publishing


## Publishing
I have published the npm package however the name "formatron" was already taken so I had to change it to: "formidable-forms-state"<br />
, you can find the project using the "formidable-forms-state"
